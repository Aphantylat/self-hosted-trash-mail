# Disposable Mailbox Service

A self-hosted, open-source disposable mailbox service (also known as "trash mail") that allows users to generate anonymous email addresses and receive emails without compromising their personal inboxes.

## Features

* Generate random, disposable email addresses
* Receive and view emails in the web interface
* Download and delete emails as needed
* Display emails as text or HTML with sanitization
* Uses a single catch-all IMAP mailbox
* Supports PHP ≥7.2 or Node.js

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need a web server with PHP ≥7.2 (or Node.js) and the IMAP extension installed. Follow the installation instructions in the README to set up the service on your own server.
